**OVERVIEW**
Company X has been approached by an international organization called JHG, which is working on sexual reproductive health. They have implemented a program in Kenya where they are giving HIV preventive medicine for free to anyone in need. The pill, which we call DP, must be taken daily to be effective. JHG has partnered with clinics across the country, who will be distributing DP pills to patients. The DP comes in packages of 30 pills. Once a month, a patient will need to go back to the clinic and receive a new package. JHG is seeing a much lower uptake and demand for the pills than they had expected. They have concluded that it must be a behavioral problem, since they have made the pills entirely free and easily accessible in hundreds of clinics across the country.
The dataset had alot of inconsistencies and erroneous values.
I adopted an exploratory approach to uncover hidden trends, and insights to diagnose the problem witnessed by reduced uptake of the drugs among patients even though its a free drug. 
This notebook entails the codes and comments detailing the approach, thought processes, finding and insights uncovered. Lastly I give recommendations, for adoption by the executive leadership.
